The TeX Catalogue License Definitions: NOINFO
Unknown Status, no information available

The license status of the software is unknown, to the extent that the creators of the catalogue can find no information whatever about it. The software should therefore be assumed to be non-free. This is the default for any software for which the license status is not known within the Catalogue. (The software may be free or nonfree but we've not been informed and have not managed to find anything for ourselves. We therefore consider the software’s status to be “All rights reserved” and therefore non-free.)

Please consider the software’s status before using any such software.

Further information about the set of licenses categories identified in the TeX Catalogue is available.
